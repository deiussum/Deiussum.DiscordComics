# Deiussum.DiscordComics
This project contains some python scripts that can be used to post the latest XKCD and/or Penny Arcade comics to a discord channel.  To use these scripts:

1. Create a web hook in Discord
2. Clone this repo
3. Create a .env file in the root folder of the repo or create environment variables for PENNY_HOOK and XKCD_HOOK that is set to the web hooks you created in step 1
4. Setup a scheduler to run the XKCD/Penny Arcade scripts at regular intervals when the new comics are usually released
